		  <p class="framebox">Ever since i was about four years old ive been in love with basketball.<br>
                    From watching my brother playing NBA 2K to my brother coaching my first basketball<br>
                    team. I havent put the basketball down since. People like Lebron and Jimmy Butler <br>
                    inspire me to keep going even when it gets difficult. Basketball has taught me to be <br>
                    mentally sound. Its taught me to contril my emotions and never let anything get me out <br>
                    of character

		 <h3 class="lenny"><strong>Giving Back</strong></h3>
		 <img src="YMCAYI.JPG"alt="" width="500" height="600">
		  <p class="framebox">One thing about me is that I love to make someones life better. Personally<br>
                    giving back to others and fulfills my happiness more than anything. My main motivation<br>
                     to being sucessful is to be able to give back to my family and community so everyone could <br>
                    be comfortable. My dream is to give as many people as possible a easier and less stressful life. <br>

		 <h4 class="lenny"><strong>Camping</strong></h4>
		 <img src="Camping.JPG"alt="" width="700" height="600">
		  <p class="framebox">Something about the outdoors is just so mentally soothing. I love being outdoors<br>
                    and enjoying the nature. Being from Los Angeles and being surrounded by the city life really<br>
                    could disconnect us from the earth where we are meant to be. Being in nature is like my natural<br>
                    medicince and healing from what this society can do to you. The outdoors is beautiful and i want <br>
                    to try and experince it as much as possible and travel the world.
